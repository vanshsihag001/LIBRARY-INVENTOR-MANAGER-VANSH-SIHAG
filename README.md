📚 Library Inventory Manager

A Mini Project for Programming for Problem Solving using Python

📌 Project Overview

The Library Inventory Manager is a simple command-line application designed to help library staff manage books efficiently. It uses Object-Oriented Programming, JSON file storage, and exception handling to create a reliable and modular system.
Users can add books, issue/return them, search the catalog, and view all stored books.
All changes are saved automatically to a JSON file (catalog.json) to maintain persistence between runs.
